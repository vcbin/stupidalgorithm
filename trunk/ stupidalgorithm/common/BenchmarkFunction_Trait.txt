uni-modal:
	Sphere,Rosenbrock
	
multi-modal:
	Rastrigin,AckeyF1,Griewank(essentially UNImodal when the dimensionality exceeds 10-15):diffcult multi-modal functions where the number of local optima increases exponentially with the problem dimension
	F5(only 2 dimension)
	
discontinuous:
	Step
