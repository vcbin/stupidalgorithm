> ## _What is is_ ##
> _Stupid Algorithm Library_ is an cross-platform,lightweight and real-valued evolutionary algorithm library with multi-threaded batch running support for automation of Evolutionary Computation algorithms evaluation and the assessment of algorithm portfolio.

> It provides a black-box which can help you choosing the best one among your algorithms/parameters portfolio:batch run scripts,algorithm statistics data generation and fine-tune ability(Matlab needed additionally)--all through one configuration file.

> ## _Feature_ ##
  1. Schedule your Evolution Computation(EC) experiments through **ONE** single configurable file with multi-threaded tasking support.(a "scheduler" thread pool with command-line support.)
  1. 5 types of evolutionary algorithm, PSO(Particle Swarm Optimization),DE(Differential Evolution),EP(Evolutionary Programming),GA(Genetic Algorithm),EDA(Estimation of Distribution Algorithm) supported currently.
  1. 22 **configurable** algorithms(Single-Objective/Multi-Objective),24 benchmark functions,4 types of termination criterion,3 types of initialization method embedded.
  1. Algorithms/Parameter-Combinations comparison(_t_-test) and result report(Excel file,Matlab needed currently)
  1. conforms to the ISO C++ 0x standard,Linux and Windows platform supported.
  1. And more to come:)
