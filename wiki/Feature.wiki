Major Features of _StupidAlgorithm_ Library


= Details =

 # Simplicity
	unattended,automatic Evolutionary Computation experiments batch running with batch-run script and performance verification(t-test) support.All you have to do is one click virtually to find the best parameter combination and best algorithms for benchmark functon suite.	
 # Concurrency
	Multi-threaded computation tasking with command line option support.
 # Flexibility
	Open-source and flexible C++ framework conform to design pattern with minimum template usage ,easy to use and be extended to other applications.
